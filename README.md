The Odin Project: Library assignment


Three main, independent arms that all need development.
1. Data input. Interrupt submit, capture input, if it's good make the object and clear elements, if it's bad toss an error. ALSO needs to be a modal.
2. Non-terrible way of generating your table from your data.
3. Editing existing data (or deleting).
    An edit should work very similarly to the original creation because you just want
    to re-create that html element from the underlying object.

2 and 3 go back to the question of how the DOM and the data objects are actually *related*.
